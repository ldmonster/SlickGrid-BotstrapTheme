## This is the fork of 6pac SlickGrid repo

I was dissapointed, when find so beatiful tables with so ugly theme, so I rework that.
Hope you will find it usefull.

I'm not a designer.

For a css, which was a begin of my path, you can thank **[this guy](https://github.com/reebalazs/SlickGrid-bootstrap)**
This theme works with original SlickGrid.
